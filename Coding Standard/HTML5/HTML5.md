# Why follow an HTML style guide

In software development teams (like ours), multiple people work on the same codebase. Especially when it comes to web markup. We need a system to streamline the process of writing good HTML makrup so that we can avoid a lot of pitfalls that can arise due to inconsistent standards followed by different people. These pitfalls include:

- Unstructured tags that lead to organizational problems and overall team frustration
- Overriden class and id names leading to inconsitencies in CSS and unexpected bugs
- Unsemantic tags leading to poor SEO optimization and faulty device specific rendering
- Inconsistent way of referencing tag hierarchy leading to dificulty in referencing 
- Unstructured and ugly CSS due to unstructured and ugly markup
