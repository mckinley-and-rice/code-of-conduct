## A quick intro to the BEM CSS paradigm 

The Block, Element, Modifier model, more than a CSS paradigm, is a UI paradigm. It is a way in which you can easily interpret and compartmentalize a UI. 
It divides the UI into Blocks (Headers, Navs, Articles, Footers etc.) then declares Elements (Buttons, Inputs etc.) contained within these Blocks and finally
assigns Modifiers(dark, outlined, disabled etc.) to these elements.
