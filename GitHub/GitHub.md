## keep a changelog

### How do I make a good changelog?

* Guiding Principles
* Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
* There should be an entry for every single version.
* The same types of changes should be grouped.
* Versions and sections should be linkable.
* The latest version comes first.
* The release date of each version is displayed.
* Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

### Types of changes

```Add ``` for new features.

```Change ``` for changes in existing functionality.

```Deprecate ``` for soon-to-be removed features.

```Remove ``` for now removed features.

```Fixe ``` for any bug fixes.

```Security```  in case of vulnerabilities.


### Blank Template for each commit as same as change log
